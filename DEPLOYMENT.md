# Deployment Migration - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What We've Done

1. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Automatically builds and deploys on push to master branch
   - Uses GitHub Pages for hosting
   - Sets proper environment variables

2. **Removed Build Files from Repository**
   - Deleted `docs/` folder from git tracking
   - Kept it in `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of build files

3. **Added Docker Setup**
   - Production-ready Dockerfile with multi-stage build
   - Uses `serve` package for lightweight static hosting
   - Docker Compose for easy local deployment
   - Comprehensive documentation in `DOCKER.md`

4. **Cleaned Up Configuration**
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` to use `VITE_GH_PAGES` environment variable
   - Simplified `package.json` scripts
   - Removed legacy build configurations

## üöÄ Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git push origin master
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (instead of "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the settings

### 3. Verify Deployment
- The GitHub Action will run automatically after you push
- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Once complete, your site will be available at: `https://fintopio.github.io/demo-dapp-with-react-ui/`

## üê≥ Docker Deployment (Optional)

For local development or alternative hosting:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build manually
docker build -t demo-dapp-react .
docker run -p 8080:3000 demo-dapp-react
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8080

## üîß Benefits of This Setup

1. **Clean Repository** - No more build files in version control
2. **Automated Deployment** - Push code and it deploys automatically
3. **No Manual Steps** - GitHub Actions handles everything
4. **Docker Ready** - Easy deployment to any container platform
5. **Environment Flexibility** - Same code works locally and in production

## üìù Future Enhancements

- Add environment-specific builds (staging/production)
- Implement automatic testing before deployment
- Add deployment notifications (Slack/Discord)
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests

## üö® Important Notes

- The first deployment might take a few minutes to set up GitHub Pages
- Make sure your repository has Pages enabled in settings
- The `VITE_GH_PAGES` environment variable ensures correct asset paths for GitHub Pages
