# Deployment

1. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Automatically builds and deploys on push to master branch
   - Uses GitHub Pages for hosting
   - Sets proper environment variables

2. **Removed Build Files from Repository**
   - Deleted `docs/` folder from git tracking
   - Kept it in `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of build files

4. **Cleaned Up Configuration**
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` to use `VITE_GH_PAGES` environment variable
   - Simplified `package.json` scripts
   - Removed legacy build configurations

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Once complete, site will be available at: `https://fintopio.github.io/demo-dapp-with-react-ui/`

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes
- The `VITE_GH_PAGES` environment variable ensures correct asset paths for GitHub Pages
